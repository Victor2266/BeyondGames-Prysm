<b>You escape into your dreams. Into a world beyond your imagination.

Struggle and fight with your own hands.
Decide how you swing your sword, parry incoming projectiles, and precisely aim your magic spells.

Wield the weapons pried from the hands of your enemies.

And defeat foe after foe until your reach the end of your journey.</b></pre>
