  desc: '<b>-Reflections on Personal Accomplishment-</b>

    Upon learning that
    I had emerged as the most intelligent participant in the competition, my emotional
    response was not confined to a mere sense of elation. Rather, I experienced a
    profound sense of achievement and an overwhelming catharsis, which had the effect
    of gratifying my ego. It is noteworthy that pride and happiness, though sometimes
    intertwined, are inherently disparate emotions. To illustrate this point, while
    I feel jubilant when complimented by a lady, my reaction to the competition results
    was a fusion of both pride and happiness. Individuals who misconstrue the vain
    and self-absorbed emotion of pridefulness for genuine happiness run the risk
    of becoming excessively egotistical and self-centered.'
